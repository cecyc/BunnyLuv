			<h2>Myths</h2>
			<article class="bunny">
				<h3>Carrots</h3>
					<img class="bunny" src="images/angry.png">
					<p>Contrary to popular belief, carrots are awful for rabbits. Carrots are very starchy and sugary. Roots like carrots are not naturally part of a rabbit's diet. Bunnies have sensitive tummies and carrots are not the best thing you could be feeding your bun.</p>
			</article>
			<article class="bunny">
				<h3>Cuddles</h3>
					<img class="bunny" src="images/cuddles.jpg">
					<p>Bunnies don't love to be picked up. But if you socialize your bunny, they will come to be comfortable with you and let you pet them. Most bunnies will remain averse to being picked up, but will be okay snuggling with you on the floor (or on the couch).</p>
			</article>
			<article class="bunny">
				<h3>Lettuce</h3>
					<img class="bunny" src="images/leafys.jpg">
					<p>Lettuce offers little nutritional value for rabbits, especially iceberg lettuce (think about it, it's all water!). Bunnies like leafy, dark greens like parsley, cilantro and carrot tops. Mint tends to be a little too much for them.</p>

			<h2>Tips</h2>
			<article class="bunny">
				<h3>Banana</h3>
				<img src="images/banana.jpg">
				<p>Bunnies are sweet-tooths, and they love banana. Fresh banana and banana chips are great. However, bananas should not be given to a rabbit with a high frequency. Again, bunnies have sensitive tummies, and bananas should be special treats, given only at special times.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article class="bunny">
				<h3>Potty trained</h3>
					<img class="bunny" src="images/litter.jpg">
					<p>Bunnies can totally be litter-trained. By nature, rabbits pick one place where they like to do their "business." Your bunny will essentially tell you where you should put the litterbox. Just keep it clean, spacious and place lots of hay around it as an incentive. Pelleted litter tends to work better for rabbits, especially paper-based pellets.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article class="bunny">
				<h3>Snow</h3>
				<img src="images/snow.jpg">
				<p>Bunnies can totally go outside, they love to explore. Just be sure you are supervising them. Some bunnies even love exploring in the snow. Do be careful, bunnies should not live outside 100% of the time if weather is too drastic. Playtime is okay, but in moderation.</p>
